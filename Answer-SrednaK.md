#### General Questions:

* What did you learn yesterday/this week?
-I learned about angular and mongodb. I used angular to develop the front end interface for a blog post. Then I used mongodb as a database to store the information that was given on the front end. I learned how angular and mongo work together to store, get, post, and manipulate information.

* What excites or interests you about coding?
-The logic behind how you can talk to a computer and make it do what you want is what I find interesting about coding. I get excited when coming up with new ways to think about problems/solutions. With coding there's always more to learn, rapid new developments everyday, and no end in site for the potential of what you can do with it.

What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?
-This would be working with angular and getting the correct information from the html. I solved it by doing some code academy tutorials online, so that I could see how a small example worked, and from there understand the process angular uses to retrieve information. 

Talk about your preferred development environment.
-My preferred environment is ubuntu-linux. I love how fast you can do things through the terminal and its really developer friendly. Its extremely customizeable, lots of shortcuts through the terminal, and supported by dev software. Overall I find it to be a straightforward kind of enviornment that allows me to work quickly and without frustration.

* Which version control systems are you familiar with?
-I use git along with the github repository.

* Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page?
-First talk about all the ideas, make notes, drawings of what it will look like. Then making diagrams of all the different components in the page. From there, making the basic directories that will be needed, setting up sass, gulp, other dev tools etc. Then I can begin setting up the semantic html and then the sass and js files. After all that stuff is put in, using minify to compact the code, compressing any large folders/files.
