* What excites or interests you about coding?

-The logic behind how you can talk to a computer and make it do what you want is what I find interesting about coding. I get excited when coming up with new ways to think about problems/solutions. With coding there's always more to learn, rapid new developments everyday, and no end in site for the potential of what you can do with it.
